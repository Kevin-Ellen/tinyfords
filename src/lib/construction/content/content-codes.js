      <h1>Finding Cars with Mattel Codes</h1>
      <p>Use Mattel toy codes to search for a car on this website to find out if it is already in the collection. These codes can also be used on other websites such as eBay to quickly locate the car.</p>
      <h2>Searching</h2>
      <p>To get the best results, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Locate the toy code</li>
        <li>Enter the code in the search bar</li>
        <li>Check if the returned results match the car you're looking for</li>
        <li>If no results are returned, the car may not be in the collection yet</li>
        <li>If you're not sure, search for the car's name to confirm its absence</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Toy Code Locations</h2>
      <h3>Hot Wheels and Matchbox Cars</h3>
      <p>Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars have a code on the back of their packaging, sometimes also on the front. Usually, it is found at the top of the backcard, and is a combination of three letters and two numbers (e.g. '<em>GTB91</em>').</p>

      <h3>Premium Cars</h3>
      <p>Premium cars may have their code located differently, such as closer to the barcode on the back of the packaging.</p>
      <p>INSERT IMAGE</p>
      <h3>Matchbox Boxes</h3>
      <p>Matchbox boxes don't have the usual backcard. Instead, the code can be found on the bottom near the barcode.</p>
