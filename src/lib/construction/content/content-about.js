      <h1>About Tiny Fords</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Tiny Fords. My name is Kevin Ellen, and I'm the creator of this website. I've been collecting Ford die-cast cars for years, and I created this website as a tool to keep track of my collection.
      <p>As my collection grew, I found myself buying duplicates and missing out on cars I wanted to add to my collection. I realized that I needed a way to easily and quickly navigate my collection online, so I wouldn't make these mistakes anymore. That's when I decided to create Tiny Fords.</p>
      <p>The website is a non-commercial site and it was created by me for myself, but I decided to share it with others as I thought we might be able to swap duplicates or identify cars I have not yet in my collection. With Tiny Fords, I can browse Hot Wheels, Matchbox and other car models easily, and avoid buying duplicates.</p>
      <p>The website was created using a Cloudflare Worker on a free account. I chose this platform because it was easy to use and it was free. I'm proud to say it was made in 2023. I didn't use any framework, it was all done by me. It was challenging, but I was determined to make it happen.</p>
      <p>In the future, I plan to add more features and improvements to the website, such as a "Want List" page, where I can keep track of the cars I'm're looking for. I also plan to keep the collection up-to-date with new additions.<p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting Tiny Fords. I hope you enjoy exploring my collection as much as I do. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via the contact page.</p>
